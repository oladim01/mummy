        <h2>To Mom,</h2>
        <div>Happy birthday to the woman who helped to make all my dreams and aspirations possible</div>
        <div>You deserve so much on your special day, and I am so sorry that youâ€™ll just have to settle for this</div>
        <br> 
        <div> It takes a special and endearing kind of love to sacrifice everything for someone else: a motherâ€™s love. Thank you for sacrificing so much so that I could have a chance at happiness. You are the absolute best, Mom!</div>
        <br>
        <div>You are the type of woman that people love and admire. You are strong, beautiful, courageous, and wise. </div>
        <br>
        <div>And I hope the lady I bring home will be someone just like you</div>
        <br>
        <div>Happy Birthday once again Mom,and may today be one of your best birthdays you have ever had.</div>
            <br>
        Your son, Fuad
